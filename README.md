# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this exercise was to visualize earthquake data for the non-profit firm, Disaster Reporting Network. The intent was to create a user-friendly and informative database to highlight the Disaster Reporting Network as a reporting and monitoring organization.

## Analysis

Using publicly accessible JSON data for earthquakes, Leaflet, and mapbox, the visualizations were creating utilizing the programming language Javascript. 

The data visualization identifies earthquakes from across the globe, plots their location, sizes by magnitude, and also identifies nearby tectonic plates. There are a number of functional overlays utilized to provide a better user experience.

## Summary

Ultimately, this project is designed to get complex and obtuse data into the hands of the average day user. The data was visualized as such that it's easy to understand and interact with. The hope is that Disaster Reporting Network can use this project as a spring board for future avenues of research and development.
